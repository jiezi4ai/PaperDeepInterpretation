        "abstract_text": "Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the\"language space\", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed\"continuous thought\"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.",
        "introduction_text": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, emerging from extensive pretraining on human languages (Dubey et al., 2024; Achiam et al., 2023). While next token prediction is an efective training objective, it imposes a fundamental constraint on the LLM as a reasoning machine: the explicit reasoning process of LLMs must be generated in word tokens. For example, a prevalent approach, known as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022), involves prompting or training LLMs to generate solutions step-by-step using natural language. However, this is in stark contrast to certain human cognition results. Neuroimaging studies have consistently shown that the language network \u2013 a set of brain regions responsible for language comprehension and production \u2013 remains largely inactive during various reasoning tasks (Amalric and Dehaene, 2019; Monti et al., 2012, 2007, 2009; Fedorenko et al., 2011). Further evidence indicates that human language is optimized for communication rather than reasoning (Fedorenko et al., 2024).  \nA signifcant issue arises when LLMs use language for reasoning: the amount of reasoning required for each particular reasoning token varies greatly, yet current LLM architectures allocate nearly the same computing budget for predicting every token. Most tokens in a reasoning chain are generated solely for fuency, contributing little to the actual reasoning process. On the contrary, some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. While previous work has attempted to fx these problems by prompting LLMs to generate succinct reasoning chains (Madaan and Yazdanbakhsh, 2022), or performing additional reasoning before generating some critical tokens (Zelikman et al., 2024), these solutions remain constrained within the language space and do not solve the fundamental problems. On the contrary, it would be ideal for LLMs to have the freedom to reason without any language constraints, and then translate their fndings into language only when necessary.  \n    \nIn this work we instead explore LLM reasoning in a latent space by introducing a novel paradigm, Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). It involves a simple modifcation to the traditional CoT process: instead of mapping between hidden states and language tokens using the language model head and embedding layer, Coconut directly feeds the last hidden state (a continuous thought) as the input embedding for the next token (Figure 1). This modifcation frees the reasoning from being within the language space, and the system can be optimized end-to-end by gradient descent, as continuous thoughts are fully diferentiable. To enhance the training of latent reasoning, we employ a multi-stage training strategy inspired by Deng et al. (2024), which efectively utilizes language reasoning chains to guide the training process.  \n  \nInterestingly, our proposed paradigm leads to an efcient reasoning pattern. Unlike language-based reasoning, continuous thoughts in Coconut can encode multiple potential next steps simultaneously, allowing for a reasoning process akin to breadth-frst search (BFS). While the model may not initially make the correct decision, it can maintain many possible options within the continuous thoughts and progressively eliminate incorrect paths through reasoning, guided by some implicit value functions. This advanced reasoning mechanism surpasses traditional CoT, even though the model is not explicitly trained or instructed to operate in this manner, as seen in previous works (Yao et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023).  \nExperimentally, Coconut successfully enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. For math reasoning (GSM8k, Cobbe et al., 2021), using continuous thoughts is shown to be benefcial to reasoning accuracy, mirroring the efects of language reasoning chains. This indicates the potential to scale and solve increasingly challenging problems by chaining more continuous thoughts. On logical reasoning including ProntoQA (Saparov and He, 2022), and our newly proposed ProsQA (Section 4.1) which requires stronger planning ability, Coconut and some of its variants even surpasses language-based CoT methods, while generating signifcantly fewer tokens during inference. We believe that these fndings underscore the potential of latent reasoning and could provide valuable insights for future research.",

        "conclusion_text": "In this paper, we presented Coconut, a novel paradigm for reasoning in continuous latent space. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that Coconut signifcantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities. Notably, our detailed analysis highlighted how an unconstrained latent space allows the model to develop an efective reasoning pattern similar to BFS. Future work is needed to further refne and scale latent reasoning methods. One promising direction is pretraining LLMs with continuous thoughts, which may enable models to generalize more efectively across a wider range of reasoning scenarios. We anticipate that our fndings will inspire further research into latent reasoning methods, ultimately contributing to the development of more advanced machine reasoning systems.",
